A very quick hacked-together page, for a couple of friends who said they wanted
something of this ilk.

If you download the file and rename it to, say, 100.html or 50000.html, it
should automatically generate an appropriate number of checkboxes.  There is no
safety checking; if you blow up your computer by setting it to a stupidly high
number, that's on you!
